;;; Commentary:

;; Run with `emacs -Q -l test.el'.

;;; Code:
(message (emacs-version))
(toggle-debug-on-error)

;; Typical `package.el' setup with Melpa:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
;; (package-initialize)
;; (package-refresh-contents)

;; Or typical `straight.el' setup:

;; (defvar bootstrap-version)
;; (let ((bootstrap-file
;;        (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
;;       (bootstrap-version 5))
;;   (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
;;     (with-current-buffer
;;         (url-retrieve-synchronously
;;          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
;;          'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
;;       (goto-char (point-max))
;;       (eval-print-last-sexp)))
;;   (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

;; Insert repro code here:

(provide 'test)
;;; test.el ends here
